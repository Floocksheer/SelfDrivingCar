# AI-Driven Autonomous Car with Computer Vision 🚗🎯
## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-enhanced autonomous vehicle that can navigate independently using computer vision and sensor data. The car detects lane markings to stay centered, recognizes traffic lights and road signs, performs autonomous parking, and responds to obstacles. It also features automatic headlights for night driving and turn signals for safer lane changes.
